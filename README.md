# Gravity Edits - AI Video Editor 🎬

Gravity Edits is a modern, AI-powered video editing platform designed to streamline the content creation process. It leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically analyze raw footage, identify viral-worthy moments, and construct a polished edit, all while giving users full creative control through a professional timeline interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🧠 Two-Stage AI Core**:
    *   **Stage 1: The Inspector (Forensic Analyst)**: A specialized agent that scans transcripts for "Ghost Words" (hallucinations like "Banana"), broken sentences, and bad takes *before* editing begins.
    *   **Stage 2: The Director (Creative Lead)**: A creative agent that uses the Inspector's "Hit List" to surgically edit the video, ensuring narrative flow while strictly adhering to the "Wakullah Protocol V2" for viral pacing.
*   **⚡️ Async Hybrid Renderer**:
    *   **Crash-Proof Architecture**: Combines the ease of **MoviePy** (for asset generation) with the raw performance of **FFmpeg** (for final stitching).
    *   **Redis-Backed**: Uses reliable job queues (RQ) to manage workload, allowing heavy renders to happen in the background without freezing the UI.
*   **📐 Precision Engineering**:
    *   **Normalized Coordinates**: Frontend and Backend interact using a normalized (0-1) coordinate system, ensuring text overlays land *exactly* where you place them, regardless of resolution.
    *   **16:9 Aspect Lock**: The interface forces a cinematic aspect ratio to prevent "Invisible Text" issues during export.
*   **📱 Viral Shorts Mode**: Instantly generates 9:16 vertical videos optimized for TikTok/Reels/Shorts, complete with smart cropping.
*   **🗣 Auto-Captioning**: Automatically generates standard `.srt` subtitle files for accessibility and SEO, synced perfectly with the final cut.
*   **🔑 BYOK Architecture**: **Bring Your Own Key** system. Your API keys (Gemini) are stored locally in your browser for maximum security and privacy.
*   **🎨 Color & Effects**: Basic color grading (Temperature, Exposure, Contrast) and text overlays.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
*   **React 19** & **TypeScript**: High-performance UI logic.
*   **Vite**: Blazing fast build tool.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Modern, responsive styling.
*   **Framer Motion**: Smooth, professional animations and drag-and-drop interactions.

### Backend
*   **Python 3.10+**: Core logic.
*   **FastAPI**: High-performance async web framework.
*   **Redis** & **RQ**: Task queue and background worker management.
*   **MoviePy**: Programmatic video editing and rendering.
*   **OpenCV**: Frame processing and analysis.
*   **Google Gemini (GenAI)**: The intelligence behind the scene detection.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   Python (v3.10+)
*   **Redis Server** (Required for background tasks)
*   FFmpeg (Required for MoviePy)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rampellisaieshwar/GravityEdits.git
cd GravityEdits
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the root directory.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (including redis, rq, fastapi)
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend directory.

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Start Redis
Ensure Redis is installed and running.
*   **Mac**: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`
*   **Linux**: `sudo apt install redis-server && sudo service redis-server start`

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

You need to run three processes: API Server, Background Worker, and Frontend.

### Terminal 1: API Server
From the root directory:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
*The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.*

### Terminal 2: Background Worker
From the root directory:
```bash
./start_worker.sh
```
*This handles video rendering and AI analysis tasks asynchronously.*

### Terminal 3: Frontend
From the `Frontend` directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.*

## 📝 Usage Guide

1.  **Welcome**: Open the app. Setup your profile with a **Gemini API Key**.
2.  **Upload**: Click "Upload Video". The AI Analysis job runs in the background.
3.  **Analyze**: Review the timeline and viral clips generated by Gemini.
4.  **Edit**:
    *   **Command**: Use the Chat to say "Cut the silence", "Make it faster".
    *   **Manual**: Drag, drop, split, and grade clips manually.
5.  **Export**: Click "Export Video". The render job is queued and processed by the worker.
