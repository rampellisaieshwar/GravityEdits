# Gravity Edits - AI Video Editor 🎬

Gravity Edits is a modern, AI-powered video editing platform designed to streamline the content creation process. It leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically analyze raw footage, identify viral-worthy moments, and construct a polished edit, all while giving users full creative control through a professional timeline interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🤖 Agentic AI Editor**: A fully autonomous AI (Gemini 2.5 Pro) that acts as a pair programmer for your video.
    *   **Natural Language Editing**: Command the AI to "Cut the part about bananas," "Add a Subscribe text at 5s," or "Fix the transcript."
    *   **Command System**: The AI emits structured commands (Cut, Split, Add Text, Move) that are executed deterministically.
    *   **Intelligent Resolution**: It understands context. "Make it red" means Reject. "Make it Green" means Keep. It finds clips by content automatically.
*   **⚡️ Async Rendering Engine**:
    *   **Non-Blocking**: Heavy tasks like Video Analysis and Rendering are handled by a dedicated background worker system.
    *   **Redis-Backed**: Uses reliable job queues (RQ) to manage workload and prevent server stalls.
*   **👻 Ghostbuster Protocol ("Wakullah")**:
    *   **Hallucination Filter**: Automatically removes low-confidence "phantom words" (e.g., random "Thank you" or "Banana" in silence) from the transcript before the AI even sees it.
    *   **Skeptical Mode**: The AI is instructed to actively distrust the transcript if words seem contextually "stupid" or out of place, surgically removing them.
*   **✂️ Smart Timeline**: A non-linear editor (NLE) with magnetic snapping, multi-track audio, and precise drag-and-drop capabilities.
    *   **Draggable Background Music**: Customize the start time and duration of your soundtrack visually.
    *   **Advanced Audio Tools**: Split, trim, and re-arrange secondary audio clips effortlessly.
*   **📱 Viral Shorts Mode**: Instantly generates 9:16 vertical videos optimized for TikTok/Reels/Shorts, complete with smart cropping.
*   **🔑 BYOK Architecture**: **Bring Your Own Key** system. Your API keys (Gemini) are stored locally in your browser for maximum security and privacy. No backend storage of sensitive keys.
*   **🎨 Color & Effects**: Basic color grading (Temperature, Exposure, Contrast) and text overlays.
*   **🚀 Efficient**: Local rendering pipeline built on **MoviePy** and **OpenCV**.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+)
*   Python (v3.10+)
*   **Redis Server** (Required for background tasks)
*   FFmpeg (Required for MoviePy)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rampellisaieshwar/GravityEdits.git
cd GravityEdits
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the root directory.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (including redis, rq, fastapi)
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend directory.

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Start Redis
Ensure Redis is installed and running.
*   **Mac**: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`
*   **Linux**: `sudo apt install redis-server && sudo service redis-server start`

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

You need to run three processes: API Server, Background Worker, and Frontend.

### Terminal 1: API Server
From the root directory:
```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
*The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.*

### Terminal 2: Background Worker
From the root directory:
```bash
./start_worker.sh
```
*This handles video rendering and AI analysis tasks asynchronously.*

### Terminal 3: Frontend
From the `Frontend` directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.*

## 📝 Usage Guide

1.  **Welcome**: Open the app. Setup your profile with a **Gemini API Key**.
2.  **Upload**: Click "Upload Video". The AI Analysis job runs in the background.
3.  **Analyze**: Review the timeline and viral clips generated by Gemini.
4.  **Edit**:
    *   **Command**: Use the Chat to say "Cut the silence", "Make it faster".
    *   **Manual**: Drag, drop, split, and grade clips manually.
5.  **Export**: Click "Export Video". The render job is queued and processed by the worker.
